In this tutorial, you will learn the fundamentals of Bayesian modeling and how to implement it using Pyro, a powerful probabilistic programming framework. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how to define and train a Bayesian model, and how to make probabilistic predictions using posterior samples. Get ready to dive into the world of Bayesian inference and unlock the full potential of your data with Pyro!"
